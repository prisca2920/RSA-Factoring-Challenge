RSA Factoring Challenge
1. take two random prime numbers p & q which are not equal 
p = 11
q = 13
2. modulo n = product of p * q
n = 11 * 13
n = 130
3. totient n = (p-1) * (q-1) 
n = (11-1) * (13-1)
n = 10 * 12
n = 120
4. select e such that e is relatively prime to totient n, gcd of e & n = 1, 1<e<n
e is the public key
